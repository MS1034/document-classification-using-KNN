        "Article": "Tips Every Freelance Content Writer Should Know   Content creation rarely happens quickly. Even experienced writers rarely produce their best work on the first draft. They revise their work several times before getting their articles out the door. In fact, the best articles you read in prestigious magazines always get some help. Just like a diva looking ravishing on the red carpet after fashion stylists, make-up artists, and hair and nail experts have done their best to prep her, so does an excellent piece of writing benefit from different inputs before being published. The truth is that many famous bloggers and authors research and then write their drafts, but a skilled editor and proofreader always comes behind to wrap up their work and finish the process. Unfortunately, up to recently, most freelance writers couldn’t afford this luxury, and editing gets often overlooked. Hello, AI Writers. Table of Contents AI Writers To The Rescue Today there are AI writers and editing tools to assist you. However, consider how you want to use them to enhance your work. For example, ChatGPT can be used to brainstorm ideas for blog posts, videos, and other content. You can also use ChatGPT to assist with optimizing your content for search engines. A job once done by SEO experts is now available via AI writers. Primarily, you can conduct your topic research via AI writers and identify trends worth writing about and sources you can use to verify your findings. AI writers are not the be-all and end-all so ,you willmustrn how to edit. 4 Editing Tips You Should Use Here are four editing tips that every freelance content writer should know and use. 1. Avoid Empty Filler Words One of the biggest mistakes content writers make is that they pack a lot of information and ideas into one sentence. They use many empty filler words that add no real value to their content. Let’s look at a few sentences to exemplify this problem: “There are many people who misunderstand the words” AS OPPOSED TO “Many people misunderstand the words.” Or “It takes patience to build trust,” AS OPPOSED TO “Trust takes patience.” The words “it” and “there” followed by a form of the verb “to be” are called grammar expletives and they dilute the writing directedness. A good editor cuts the superfluous use of expletives and emphasizes the proper drivers in the sentence. 2. Avoid Weak Verbs Choosing the proper verbs can make your writing clearer, stronger, and more persuasive. A strong verb can paint a vivid picture in your readers’ minds. Consider the following sentence: “She was a fast runner.” That is a good sentence that can project a concrete image in your mind. Now, consider the more descriptive option “She flew like the wind as she speeded down the track.” You can easily imagine her racing, right? Content writers often use the verb “to be” in the first draft. The problem with “to be” verbs is that they can weaken the words that follow. The solution is to replace them with more powerful alternatives. For example, instead of “The weather was beautiful.” use “The sun shone brightly that day.” 3. Avoid Weak Adjectives Similar to verbs, adjectives can drain out the energy from your text. Savvy editors and content creators avoid using words like “very” and “really” before common adjectives. Some examples are: “Really bad” instead of “Excruciating.” “Really good” instead of “Excellent.” Or “Very common” instead of “Ordinary.” Taking “very” and “really” out of the equation is certainly a “great” thing, as is the use of strong alternatives. For example: Use “Thrilled” instead of “Happy.” Use “Filthy” instead of “Dirty.” Use “Delicious” instead of “Tasty.” You should use the most descriptive language to trigger the reader’s senses and help them imagine how things smell, sound, taste, and feel. 4. Know Your Punctuation You can be the best storyteller in the world. If you lack grammar skills, your mistakes will turn readers off. While an auto-correct program can quickly detect typos, more subtle errors can sneak into your text. The sparingly use of the comma is one of the most common punctuation mistakes most freelance content writers make. Here’s an example: “You can neglect editing, and the audience reading your text may not notice, but your ideas will be lost.” In case you didn’t notice, the missing comma between “editing” and “” suggest “means you can neglect the audience reading your text,” which is precisely the opposite of what you should do or intend, for that matter. Of course, if you read it again, you will realize the sentence’s meaning. But, if people need to go back to grasp what you’re saying, your ideas AND your audience will likely be lost. Conclusion Small changes in your writing can fuel enthusiasm and make people devour your post. It’s just a matter of finding the most potent and specific words.  If however, this really is too hard for you, there is always the content writer’s little helpers – AI writers!"

        "Article": "How Using A CRM Can Optimize Your Content Marketing   CRM tools have many features most users don’t know exist, let alone use. In fact, most software has many more features than most users typically use. Liken the uptake to Pareto’s 80/20 rule where only 20% of the features are used. Imagine the lost opportunities when your marketing team are using so few features! This article looks at CRMs and how using more features helps optimize your content and digital marketing. Table of Contents What is CRM? What does it do? CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management, and it’s used to nurture consumer interactions and drive business success. Specifically, it helps you do the following: Identify profitable sales opportunities Store relevant prospect and buyer information Document service problems Oversee marketing campaigns, etc. A CRM helps you harmonize your management tasks for sales, marketing, and customer relationships, so what are some of its features? CRM features include: Contacts, leads, tasks and campaign management Sales data and analytics Dashboards and report generation Sales forecasting Marketing automation Content database Image repository library Mobile CRM, and more Are you using all these features? Plus, there are more tailored features in the industry-specific CRMs. Industry-specific CRM For example, there are automotive industry CRMs customized to meet dealerships’ unique lead management needs. Other industries also have customized CRMs, including: Healthcare Manufacturing eCommerce Legal Accounting Real Estate and more So the next question is – how can you use your CRM to optimize your content marketing campaigns? Optimizing Your Content Marketing Let’s have a look at what to do with a CRM to improve your content marketing success. 1. Refined Buyer Personas To Target Capture, store and organize customer information, i.e. buyer personas within your CRM. Using the data captured in the CRM, you can uncover insights on your customers through their actions and journeys. With this intel, you can create relevant content for your marketing campaigns that target specific customer demographics, i.e. your target audience. For example: How an automotive CRM connected to a car dealership’s blog can empower marketers. Site visitors read a particular blog post before visiting the 2021 Honda CR-V product page, requesting information or making a purchase! The automotive CRM confirmed the blog post had content on the five best cars for young professionals The CRM also confirmed the inquires and buyers of 2021 Honda CR-V were mostly in their late 20s Conclusion: No marketer hungry for insights will ignore information that tells them how to craft content for specific customer demographics. Refining your buyer persona is essential for doing less work with more resources. Analysis helps marketers create topics and content that truly appeals to targeted audiences. 2. Customer Segmentation CRM tools also help you sort your customers according to their demographics, interests, jobs, company sizes, industry, etc. Customer segmentation can also include pages on your site that customers visited and show their engagement. Engagement varies, and it’s a big topic; however you can set up and view metrics from time spent on site, the content viewed and conversions (sales). Customer segments can go further, too, assisting with your marketing content and their publication schedules. For example: A law firm uses a CRM to monitor its online client activities on its website. The CRM reveals visitors of various ages watching specific videos at different times as well. The legal office can categorize these visitors into, e.g.: 40-year-old couples viewing divorce-related video materials on late weeknights Aged 30-something professionals watching overviews on managing workplace conflict during weekday lunch breaks Middle-class residents consuming videos about land disputes every Sunday afternoon, etc. With this hyper-specific information, the law firm can easily determine the best content to create for which audience group on which days and times. This is advantageous, especially if you have a diverse clientele and suite of service offers. 3. The Customer Journey Not all website visitors immediately convert and buy your products and services. Some take time, but every consumer typically goes through a series of phases in their interaction with a business. Marketers call this the customer journey, which usually has the awareness, consideration, and purchase (or decision) stages. A CRM tool helps you determine and track your customers’ progress by extracting updated data from several sources and organizing prospects accordingly. Knowing prospects’ specific stages of their journey is crucial since each stage requires a unique set of marketing tactics to get their buy-in. This intel helps you develop relevant, targeted messages that resonate with your intended audience for your content marketing campaigns. For example: How an eCommerce retail shop sells herb-infused beverages. The CRM reports reveal how long it takes for a customer to purchase by measuring site activities. For example, the site visitor may read several blog posts, repeatedly visit the product page, and put items in carts — but later abandon the cart. The eCommerce retail shop can review the website content and sales strategy and conclude why the cart abandonment was how the invitation to buy was presented within the blog posts content. The blog topics were likely to be niche and relevant to site visitors who already know the product. For the visitors that need more steps in the buying process, e.g.choosing the best flavor for their nutritional needs or understanding garment sizing before adding a shirt to the cart, revise the content and sales process to include the extra step. Plus, remember to match your content appropriately with the stages of progress, including: Awareness: blog and social media posts, educational webinars, checklists, whitepapers, kits, tools, tip sheets, ebooks, how-to videos Consideration: free sample, case study, product comparison guide Decision: coupons, live demo, free trial, consultation offers 4. Repackaging High-Performing Content CRM reports will present data on the content and campaigns that yield optimal results. Leverage all insights when planning your content and reuse or repackage the material to engage your intended audience. Probe into your best-performing content according to the CRM insights. Check its compelling elements and apply the same for your next content pieces. Creating templates will be great when reusing the content. You can also repackage it in other forms. For instance, you can turn a case study into videos, infographics, webinars, blog posts, etc. Final Thoughts You can get a lot more from a CRM than just a data repository. Information is power, and in this blog post, we highlighted how using more features of your CRM can help you make your content marketing work harder for your business."

        "Article": "Is Your Content Authentic And Trustworthy?   Is your content marketing authentic and trustworthy? Or is it regularly misused for advertising and sale pitches? This article shares insights on how your content marketing can engage customers, improve your brand, and increase website traffic and rank. First, rule out what you shouldn’t do with your content marketing. Table of Contents Avoid The Selling Trap Time is money, and content marketing incurs a lot of time. Plus, you’re dipping into your marketing budget if you’re using a third party, i.e., a copywriter, to create your blog posts and articles. However, this doesn’t afford you any leeway to add sales pitches. 🙂 The fastest way to disengage with customers and damage your credibility as a trusted advisor is to ‘blow your own trumpet’ overtly or attempt to disguise selling as something else of value in your content marketing content. All businesses need a sales strategy, including posts on platforms your customers frequent. For example, when you need to push a new product or promotion, be transparent and construct your advertisement in a campaign that lets your audience know you have something to share about your business, product, or service. Sneak in the sales pitch. In your email marketing posts on social media and your website, you can use long-form content like an ‘advertorial’ but call it what it is instead of using content marketing to ‘sneak in the sales pitch’ somewhere, hoping to fool your audience. An example of selling in a blog post is using an anchor like ‘click here’ for more information, and the linking page is to an online shop, not to more detail on the topic presented in the article’s content. Consumers only need to experience this insult to their intelligence once to leave them with a negative impression of your business. Maybe it’s not your fault as you or your marketing team were wrongly advised by a third party like a link builder. Or that you, as an outreach marketer, caved in when pressured by your client to get ‘do follow’ links to their home page. According to Google, did you know all sponsored links in content need to be identified as such? When accepting guest posts, publishers need to be vigilant and mark external links sponsored as sponsored, no, follow, or both. How to Create Content That’s Authentic Highly informative articles focusing on knowledge transfer don’t just work hard in the short term. They’re everlasting insofar as good content is always found in searches and shared. It’s this content that Google ranks highly, too, so wasting time with subterfuge actions that your customers are not fooled by is counterproductive. Start working on a long-term strategy for your content marketing with unique, relevant content that genuinely resonates with your audience. Write content that inspires you. When you’re writing your own content, it’s a lot more enjoyable when it’s on a topic that interests you. Your writing style will ooze your enthusiasm for the subject, keeping your readers engaged. External input from leading authorities. When searching for experts and articles on the same topic, the Internet is your best friend. Search online for keywords relating to your content topic to find out what has been written about it and consider how you can improve their message in your article. Always reference your sources in your content. Introduce facts, statistics, and opinions. All content should show you’ve done your research. Introduce results from surveys and studies and present data and statistics to support your content. Articles that are well-researched and written do take longer. The average article of 1000 words may take up to six hours. However, if you’re not up for writing 1000+ words, every post focuses on quality over quantity. There is no right or wrong answer for how how long a blog post will take, and you’ll never know when you finish it. If you’ve created that article, it will be stand-out and loved by all, including Google. Summing up Many marketers and some businesses are less interested in the long-term gain of content marketing: their content marketing style churns and burns their audience and brand reputation. Stop using short-term traditional marketing strategies for content marketing as it really needs a long-term approach. You can make an immediate impact when you avoid ‘selling’ in blogs, guest posts, and articles. Remember, hiding that you’re just promoting a service or product will fool no one.  Transparency and clear communication are the only way to get more from your content. Blogging is a topic we love, and there’s no end to what you can learn and do with it.

        "Article": "3 Content Marketing Tips to Boost Your SEO   What can you do better with your content marketing to get out in front and ahead of your competitors? Use three proven strategies not once but all the time! This article focuses on three sure-fire actions you can take to get more traction with your existing and new content contributions. Your blog posts, articles, social media posts, videos, reviews, feedback, and more can work harder for you. The starting point is knowing actions to take and repeat to boost your SEO with your content. The following recommendations are in no particular order; all need your attention as and when required. Let’s start with analytics. Table of Contents Use Customer Journey Analytics Whether you’re using Google Analytics or a more advanced solution, focus on customer journey analytics which tells you much about your users. Deep analytics give you insights into what people like and don’t like. Consider it like having access to a built-in user survey without your readers having to answer a single question. On-page and bounce rates Your website will have pages that get the lion’s share of attention. Look at your website pages with the longest on-page time and lowest bounce rates in your analytics system. These ratings tell you what people are enjoying about your site content. With this information, you can hone in on what attracted users to the page and what is on it that holds their attention. If the page is an article – is it the title, the topic, or how it’s written, the layout using bullet points, headings, images, and videos. Does the page have a call to action, for example, a type of interactive content like a quiz or poll? Knowing how to interpret website analytics is visitor and customer feedback for your marketing campaigns without asking for it! However, capturing the data and learning how to get what you need from it is just the beginning you also need to use to improve your SEO and online performance. Write Click-Worthy Title Tags Google measures user-interaction signals for its ranking algorithm, including click-thru rate. The more clicks your website gets from Google, the more Google will boost your rankings. Click-worthy titles are priceless and serve as the introduction to your brand. First impressions can literally make or break your copy. Keyword Title Tag When drafting your title, develop title tags with a keyword to make it click-worthy. Boring titles do not attract users, and clickbait turns them off. Marketing is a value-based commodity; you do it right if your title draws readers in and your content keeps them engaged. Keywords are the magic words that connect you to readers. Using them in your title will ensure that your work is seen. Use descriptors Be concise and use descriptors. What are readers looking for in your content offers? Use descriptors that differ from existing content title tags so your titles stand out. Reveal Say what you’re offering. Your title is the first thing users see, so make it count. Tell them what they will get, i.e.,10 Healthiest Smoothies for Weight Loss. Original Make it unique, and spark curiosity. Make your title the unicorn in the field of horses. Ask yourself, what would make you stop and read this? Write For the Internet Since one user interaction signal that Google measures is dwell time, the longer someone stays on your article, the better it is for your SEO. Quality The quality of your content is the most crucial way to draw users to your brand. Then to capture users’ attention and keep it, you’ll need to make each word count, keep it concise and offer value. Originality What do you offer that is original and captivating? The element of surprise you offer will draw people toward your brand and keep them coming back. Offer solutions to customers’ everyday challenges, which keeps them engaged with your content. Structure So you need to write using short paragraphs of 1-3 sentences. And you need to break up the text with images, bullet points, and quote blocks to make the page more readable. As you develop content, make sure you write for keywords. Most people searching on Google are looking for answers to questions. Your articles will increase rankings if your content answers questions more succinctly and correctly than your competitors.  You can use these ideas to create helpful content for your readers while paying attention to keywords and interestingly offering answers to their questions. Internet writing is different from writing for print, so it may take a slight shift in mindset as you develop content. Most people do other things while they read, while some only skim through. When you can attract readers with fun, helpful content, there is a greater chance you will retain their focus and offer additional content that will keep them engaged in your brand. Step out and differentiate yourself from the herd of other content providers. Summary Keep it simple and follow these recommendations to get more traction with your content marketing campaigns.  Analytics are your best friend when you know how to read and put them to good use tweaking your content for higher conversion. Content provision is never accessible but a necessity.  Set goals and rewards when your campaigns show you’re heading in the right direction."

        "Article": "The Best Tactics to Keep in Mind When Trying to Write Quality Content   In the world of search engine optimization, content is most definitely king. Today, one of the most impactful and positive things you can do for your site and its outreach is creating fantastic content that your growing audience can read, engage with and learn from. That being said, it can be pretty hard to precisely identify what exactly makes great content. How can you produce the right amount of valuable and shareable content? The unfortunate truth is that you can consistently produce a great flow of new and fresh content and still not get the conversion rate and organic traffic you are hoping for. The reason for that is typical because even though your content is excellent, it is not answering the needs of your audience. Table of Contents Why Your Blog Needs Top Quality Content Your content simply has to be the best, and It has to stand out compared to the competition. Perhaps most importantly, it has to strike a chord with the people reading it, and it typically takes quite a bit of research (but we’ll get to that later). If you are looking for ways to improve your content creation game, here are some tried and true tactics that you may want to consider. Tactics To Improve your Content Keep an eye on social media. You’re probably already pretty tuned in to the activity of your brand on major social media channels. If you’re not, you definitely should be! But that knowledge alone is not nearly enough. Make sure that you expand your attention to social media to capitalize on viral trends or issues that relate to your niche and business. You may be able to identify the very questions your audience merely has by paying closer attention to what conversations are being had on platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and more. Make sure you really know who you’re selling to You must keep in mind that your customers are more than just demographics with variable purchasing power at every stage of your business. When you are thinking of content that you want to specifically get your customers involved in, it is of the utmost importance to consider who they really are. Look at customer notes, comments and complaints to spark up inspiration for your latest content post. Another great way to get inside your customers’ heads is to offer customer questionnaires on your site. Ask them how they feel about your brand. Ask them how they think about your products or services. This will give you ample material to work with when creating content, but it will also help your customers feel more involved in the business and more heard. This will only help lead to greater customer loyalty. Don’t you think understanding your customer base is essential? Consider the research done by Invesp, which found that creating a compelling buyer persona can result in an increase in conversion by an incredible 238 per cent. Check out the competition. In the dog-eat-dog world of business today, there is nothing wrong with looking into where your competitors are succeeding compared to you by taking a look at what kind of content is getting great feedback on the site of your major competitors. You can do this in one of two ways. First off, you can simply look on their site and see what content is getting the majority of shares and responses. The other more in-depth way to figure out what is resonating on your competitor’s pages is by doing a competitor content audit. This will offer you a comprehensive look at what is working in your industry. It is precious information that you can use to improve your digital marketing strategy and your search engine optimization strategy. Another significant aspect of taking a look at your competition is to see what kind of social media influencers they are working with. While you may not want to straight-up poach influencers from your game, you can certainly see how they use influencers and take advantage of their outreach and followership. Research your keywords Indeed, keywords are not quite as impactful as they used to be when it comes to improving the outreach of your site and content (tactics like keyword stuffing are very much a thing of the past), but that does not mean that keywords no longer matter. They totally do! A great way to utilize keywords is to pick up your keyword research to see what people are talking about online, sharing and responding to. You can check keyword research tools such as this list here or just use ahrefs – or another keyword tool. Use essential keywords to think up great title ideas or combine different keywords to develop a great new topic for your blog. Don’t undermine the importance of your title It can be easy to overlook just how crucial a title to your articles are, but missing the first thing that a potential reader sees is a severe mistake. Even when you know exactly what you want to write and have some fantastic ideas about what topics you will cover, take a deep breath and spend 5-10 minutes really thinking about the title of your new work. Better yet, think about talking with some of your coworkers to see if they have any good ideas regarding a title. They might have a completely different approach that can improve the title and the content you are writing about. A title should be quick and concise, draw readers in but not be clickbait. It’s a balance, and with that extra time, you can indeed find that outstanding balance. Research, research, research You want to make engaging and informational content, and one of the best ways to make sure that you actually achieve that goal is to jampack your work with valuable information. Don’t just write two to three pages of puff that doesn’t even teach the reader anything. Another type of research that you want to do is find out what actually works when it comes to content creation. Back in 2017, Buzzsumo looked at 100 MILLION posts to find out what people tend to share and why. The results were incredibly useful when it comes to content creation. For the most part, longer content is more popular. Images are particularly critical to success, and people tend to share things that they are emotionally connected with rather than intellectually connected with. Believe it or not, the most common emotion linked with shareability was awe with 25 percent. The second most popular emotion was laughter was 17 percent. The second was Amusement with 15 percent. Believe it or not, considering what you hear about on the news, anger only took up six percent of shares on social media. It is never a bad idea to include some cold-hard facts in your content either. There is no need to turn your content into a PhD dissertation, but it certainly doesn’t hurt to back up some of your claims with factual information. Don’t forget to optimize So, you’ve done the necessary research and have put your blood, sweat and tears towards creating an exceptional piece of content that your customers will surely enjoy. You’re close to the finish line, but you’re not there yet! Now is the time to take the content you have written and make sure that you optimise your work before publishing by way of on-page search engine optimization. If your writing has a specific, overall focus, chances are you really already have the keywords and concepts necessary. Still, it is important to keep in mind the important SEO you want to keep in mind before you publish: Make sure your meta description is concise yet descriptive Make sure your sub-headers contain keywords and variants Link to authority sites that you have used to build out your content Link to internal pages that are related to the content to keep visitors engaged with your site Add images with descriptive alt text Incorporating visual media such as videos and slideshows is not necessary to the success of your content, but it can definitely help! It is also essential to keep in mind that there is simply no way to predict whether or not a bit of content that you create will be successful or not. Summary As hard as that may be to hear, no amount of hard work necessarily means your new creation is going to gain traction. That being said, if you consistently work to pump out well-written posts loaded with great information and insight, your audience will gradually grow. It will likely take patience – and it could take many months for you to really see the fruits of your labor, but those fruits will come! Content is, in many ways, the personality of your business. It not only gives your audience and customers something to read, but it also lets them know about you, your personality, your interests, and so much more. Don’t consider content just a simple transaction. Use it as a tool. Use it as a way to work out questions you are having within your own business practices. It can be gratifying in more ways than one. All you have to do is start writing!"

        "Article": "5 Productivity Hacks To Help You Get More Done On Your Blog   Being a one-man or woman band when blogging is not only exhausting, it is also very inefficient. You can only do so much in the day, yet your blogging to-do list could have you in front of your screen 24 hours a day. To be a successful blogger, you have to manage your time and be extremely organized. You’ll need to plan out your day, week and month to ensure that you are producing so your blog can grow. Burn out is very real when blogging and is the reason most fail at it. That, and not seeing results and feeling like your hard work is for nothing. In this article, I will go over some ways to be more productive so you can get more done in less time. You’ll enjoy the success you’re seeing from your blog and also the free time from your productivity. Table of Contents 1 – Time tracking To see where you need to be more efficient with your time, you have to know how you are spending your time working on your blog. Use a time tracker app to segment all of your tasks to see how much time you spend doing each. You may find that you are inefficient with your time. For instance, you should probably do certain tasks together and others at another time. When you’ve figured out how you’re spending your time working on the blog, then you know where you can be most productive, as you will see in the hacks coming up next. 2 – Outsource Let’s look at your content creation process. Let’s say that you spend 20% of your time researching a topic for your post. Then another 10% outlining your post. And 70% of your time writing it. This would suggest that you can do something about the writing segment to make your process faster. The best way is to hire a freelancer to take on some of the work. You could research and outline an article and then pass that on to a writer to create the content. If you find you spend a lot of time doing social media and not creating new content, you should look into hiring a social media manager to take on some of the work. 3 – Batch your work Suppose you are early in your blogging career and don’t have the budget to outsource. You can still do all of the work yourself if you use your time wisely. For instance, batching your work on certain days or certain times is a very efficient way to use your time. Using the same content creation example, you can set aside a day where you only do research. Fill up a spreadsheet with article ideas complete with all the keyword research and outline for each post. Then on another day, do the actual writing. When you do every task one at a time, it is grossly inefficient. Instead of researching, then outlining and then writing, you will find your workflow much smoother by doing each task all at once. 4 – Use your readers to generate content Getting free content is a great way to grow your blog while doing other tasks aside from writing. Having your readers make content for you is a fantastic way to do this. It can come in many forms. You can ask questions in your blog posts on the blog itself and encourage people to answer in the comments. This extra content is usually rich in keywords that can be picked up by Google. Another way is to ask people who have products that you are reviewing to make a short video about how they like the product. You can post the video on your site or make a Youtube channel for a traffic boost without making the videos yourself. 5 – Get some fresh air Spending too much time working on your blog will actually slow down your progress and limit your productivity. You need to get outside and go for a walk or run to get the blood flowing and get some fresh air. This will give you a much-needed energy boost to use when you get back to work on your blog. It can also help you think about things that can help you overcome something that might block your progress. Walking is a great way to clear the mind for problem-solving, so use the time for this instead of looking at a blank screen when you have a writer’s block."

        "Article": "3 Content Tips For B2B Marketing   While content creation can be a challenge for many businesses, B2B businesses seem to have a tough time with content strategy and content creation. Because writing for a business’s decision-makers can be different from writing for a traditional consumer, many businesses writing B2B content struggle. But with the right planning and preparation done before you sit down to actually create any content, you will find just how easy it can be to create content for a B2B business. Table of Contents 3 Ways To Create B2B Content To show you just how this can be done, here are three tips for creating content for B2B marketing purposes and ensuring that that content connects with your target market. 1. Get To Know Your Audience With Personas Just like creating content for B2C businesses, B2B businesses should start by creating personas for the type of customers or clients they want. Not only will this make it easier for you to visualize who you’re creating your content for, but it can also help you narrow down the focus of your content. Solve problems According to Neil Patel, an online marketing guru, the buyer personas you create for B2B content should focus primarily on their problems or struggles and how you, as a business, will address those issues. Once you have this information nailed down, it will be much easier to develop content ideas that will help you fulfill both variables. For example, you can create content addressing the problems that your personas face and how using something like your products or services can show major improvement for their organization. Clearly articulate how your product or service solves your B2B customers’ problems or fulfills their needs. Focus on your unique value and how it aligns with their business objectives. Research and analyze customer data To help create personas, research and analyze your target B2B audience thoroughly. Understand their industry, pain points, goals, and decision-making process. To create buyer personas representing different segments within your audience, consider your existing customers’ benchmarks. Review the existing customer data and reach out to your customers to collect what you need to build your ideal buyer personas. 2. Browse Online For New Topics And Ideas Another way you can find great fodder for content ideas, according to Dan Shewan, a contributor to WordStream.com, is to see what people are talking about online.By tapping into current hot topics in your industry, you may find that your content has a further reach due to people being interested in consuming all they can about this issue or idea. To best do this, you must first know where your target market spends their time online. Once you can find them, getting involved in whatever online communities they’re in can be constructive so you can see what trending topics are being discussed. What you’re doing here is keeping up with conversations. With this information in hand, you can create content for your target personas relevant to you and your business and timely in that it addresses current concerns that people within your industry are dealing with. Personalize your content based on the recipient’s industry, role, challenges, etc. This can be done through targeted email campaigns, personalized landing pages, and relevant content suggestions. 3. Write Content That Adds Value If you’ve been creating content for quite a while, you might feel like you’ve completely maxed yourself out on new ideas. And while this might be partially true, there are always ways to look at things differently or come at an idea from a new angle to help you create an entirely new piece of content. To help you with this, Honey Singh, a contributor to Entrepreneur.com, recommends that you try to find a balance between posting content on a regular schedule that will help your content marketing and SEO efforts with only posting content that you feel adds real value. If this means posting fewer pieces of content, then so be it. Educate However, keep in mind that it’s important to remember that all the content you create for your target demographics should add some kind of value for them. B2B customers often appreciate content that educates them about industry trends, best practices, and emerging technologies. Create whitepapers, ebooks, webinars, and guides that showcase your expertise and provide valuable insights.  Use AI writers to assist you with your content. Every content should have a clear and relevant CTA that guides the reader to the next step in their journey, whether downloading an ebook, requesting a demo, or contacting your sales team. Use Evidence B2B customers are more likely to be swayed by data, statistics, and real-world evidence. To support your claims, incorporate case studies, success stories, customer testimonials, and industry benchmarks. Track the performance of your B2B content using relevant metrics like engagement rates, conversion rates, and lead generation. Analyze the data to identify what’s working and needs improvement, then optimize your content strategy accordingly. Remember that B2B customers are typically more rational and focused on ROI than B2C customers. Your marketing content should build trust, demonstrate expertise, and provide concrete value to help them make informed business decisions."

        "Article": "Content Marketing Ideas to Implement in 2022   The opportunity to invite change in your business and onboard new ideas will benefit the company. To do so needs careful analysis of every aspect of your business. One of the most important departments to focus your attention on is the marketing team. Marketing strategies that worked in a few years ago might not necessarily work as well now, so it is crucial to find new ideas to implement so that your business stays relevant, fresh, and, most importantly, competes well. The key is focusing on quality content for SEO. Here are some content marketing ideas that you can introduce to your team this year that will help you maintain success. Table of Contents Written content Backlinks If you aren’t already doing so, you need to implement a content marketing strategy that focuses on backlinks. In order to bring more traffic to your website, you need to improve your search ranking position on the SERPs. For many, the goal is to achieve that number one spot, or even better, position zero. Although the algorithms can often change, the more backlinks that you have, the more value it will add to your domain authority. However, it’s important to note that the content must be of high quality. Google will spot filler content that is not adding anything of value from a mile off. Therefore, you should make sure that, if you want Google to view your content positively, it must be of high quality. If this isn’t your strong suit, there are content writing services that can help you create high-quality content. Implement a successful link building marketing strategy, and Google will see that you are a company that people can trust, and therefore, your ranking on their search engine should improve. Top Tip: The more influence a site has, the more it will benefit you, so try to reach out to domains of high authority within Google. Blog on your site Creating content around backlinks works, but so does having content on your own website. If you’ve managed to bring the traffic to your site, that is one thing, but being able to keep and make sales is another thing. So, it is just as important to focus on the content that is going on your site. If you still haven’t gotten around to starting a blog, then make now the year to change that. The internet has made it easier to compare different businesses, so you need to find a way that shows the customer you are the company they should do business with. A blog can show customers that you are truly an expert in your field. Video content Written content isn’t going to appeal to everyone. Therefore, you need to find other means of reaching out to as many people as possible. The solution is video. Video content is being hailed as the future of content marketing, and that is probably due to the influx of mobile usage. 75 million people watch online videos every day, through social media and YouTube, and so with these kinds of figures, there is no reason you shouldn’t be jumping on board with video content marketing. Video content offers lots of possibilities in terms of what you can do. Working with a film company can help you to produce a TV advert, a marketing campaign or brand film depending on the budget you have. You can sit down and discuss strategically what video content you would like to produce. Your audience will be a huge factor in what you focus on. For example, if most of your audience spends their free time watching TV, rather than through streaming devices, then the more traditional route of a television advert is more suitable. Another article that will interest you is how to craft content for featured snippets."

        "Article": "How To Make Your Own Blog Successful   Many people have an idea of what they would like to do with their blogs. There are many ways to go with it; in effect, a blog is your own personal corner of the internet, and it is up to you how you use it. Everyone has one common goal, whatever the style of topic of their blog; to make it successful. For bloggers, success is subjective. Blogging may mean popularity and the potential to make money. Views are what matter most. So the main question is: how to make your own blog? Follow our six tips and you’ll have a good foundation for a successful blogging website. Table of Contents Find your niche This is a rule that isn’t specifically followed for blog users, but for people looking to be creative in general. Finding a niche is all about finding balance; while you want to stand out and be seen by others, which means doing something different and as unique as possible, it still has to be relevant and interesting. If you go too far one way, you’ll get lost in the crowd, but too far the other and there won’t be enough people who want to know what you’ve written to click on your posts and boost the view count. Build your blog on a reputable host provider You’ll need to host your blog on a provider that works for you. There are plenty out there and it’s about finding the right one. Some are more suited to certain styles, more creative, fun blogs for example. Whatever you choose, make sure you go with what is right for the demographic you’re aiming for. Find a host that provides you a server that is close to your target group. That is one of the most important factors while creating an online business. For example, don’t choose a hosting provider that has his server in South Africa while you are targeting users from the US. If you do – then your website loading time will be very slow. The result is that users won’t stay at your website. Do it yourself, don’t hire someone to do it for you Designing a blog is personal, and tailoring a blog is personal too. You shouldn’t hire someone to do this for you because even if they follow your instructions, it’ll never feel quite as pure as when you do it yourself. After all, this article is called how YOU can make your blog a success. The first step is to set it up and design it yourself. Write honest content Whatever your writing principles, stick to them. Be honest, don’t go changing your style or your focus in order to gain more views because in the long run, it’ll not work out. If you stick to what you want to write, at the end of the day you’ll be much happier, and your readership will be much more organic. It may take time to make it work but be patient and don’t move away from why you started your blog in the first place. Go mobile This is another point that is really aimed at a wider audience than just blog users. It is important to move with the times, and technology means that most people are reading articles on smartphones these days. It is important to make your blog mobile-friendly so that people can access it properly out and about. Have fun! Finally, these are among the most important things you must do. If you’re not enjoying the experience, you won’t showcase your best work. Keep the core values of your blog close and make them the reason why you do it. Focus on your authentic content and let the visitors and success find you. From there, everything else will fall into place and who knows? Maybe soon you’ll be working from a beach bar somewhere in Thailand. Check out our article about how to become a digital nomad."

        "Article": "How Your Credit Score May Impact Your Career   In general, your personal credit score is not directly tied to your career performance or qualifications. However, did you know there are some situations where your credit history may indirectly impact your professional life? With nearly 30% of Americans suffering from terrible credit, it’s hard for many people to get out of the credit hole they’ve gotten into. Once you have bad credit, the other financial elements of your life become a struggle, and before you know it, your credit score is preventing you from getting a loan to buy essentials like a car or house! Are you applying for jobs and missing out? Employers do not have to tell you why you missed out on a role, including if it is the reason for your credit score rating. This article examines why everyone should aim for a near-perfect credit score before they need it. Table of Contents Credit Score and Your Career We mentioned earlier that employers can choose what they disclose regarding a role or job application rejection, so you may end up applying for many roles without realizing the elephant in the room is your credit score. Limited disclosure Employers can use limited disclosure to avoid sharing the reasons for rejecting you for a role. Employers can use broad-stroke reasons like ‘you didn’t meet the qualifications’ instead of telling you why you missed out. This answer is unhelpful, as as an applicant, you are likely to make the same error repeatedly and continue to miss out on suitable roles. Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) However, when employers want to do a credit check, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires them to seek your permission and get it in writing. Additionally, you may not have known that you can review the report they get. Insist on seeing the credit report and getting professional advice on improving it. Credit report If your credit report is not between 740 and 850, chances are you can improve it. State Laws Some states have laws that restrict credit score use in employment decisions. Currently, there are eleven states. Is your state included? California, Hawaii, Washington, Connecticut, Nevada, Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Oregon, Vermont, and Illinois. Why Employers Need Credit Reports We’ve mentioned job applications where employment background checks can include reviewing your credit history. Industries with financial responsibility, such as accounting, finance, and roles involving handling company finances, commonly seek a credit report as part of applicant background checks. Financial Roles Most roles involve financial management or fiduciary responsibility and will likely require an excellent personal credit score. Examples of roles in financial services may include bank tellers, loan officers, investment advisors, and anyone handling clients’ money. Individuals applying for fiduciary roles, such as lawyers, trustees, and corporate board members, may also be required to authorize a credit check. Security Additionally, security is another sector, and any role that requires security clearance might require a detailed look at your financial history and credit score. People with high levels of debt are seen as risky as they might be susceptible to bribery or fraud due to economic pressures. Five Actions That Can Harm A Credit Rating 1. Closing an account at the wrong time While this action seems a bit ridiculous, you must decide when to close an account used for a loan. Closing your account too soon after you’ve paid off the balance can harm your loan accounts, such as credit cards. You may have paid off the loan on one account by transferring the balance to another and then promptly closed the nil balance account. While this is a logical step to take, the timing of the account closure can harm your credit rating. 2. Transferring your balances over to one card We’ve all heard of debt consolidation, and it’s not only a convenient solution. You also benefit from a better interest rate, so you’re paying less on the loan amount over time. Many lenders, including the big banks, advertise this strategy to reduce debt; however, if you still need to borrow funds now that all your debt is loaded onto one card, you can appear as a high-risk borrower, which impacts your credit rating. For your credit rating, did you know you’re better off spreading your borrowing over a few credit cards, so each card has a maximum of 30% owed than it is to have one card up with a high credit limit and you’re using most of it? Therefore, debt consolidation may not be excellent if you rely on your current credit score. 3. Keeping charge-offs on your credit report A charge-off is a debt the creditor deems unlikely to pay off because you have failed to meet your monthly payments for a significant period. The account is listed on your credit report as not collectible, where it will remain for seven years, potentially impacting your credit. However, you can sometimes remove your charge-offs before the seven years are up. 4. Falling behind on medical bills You might not realize that if you’ve had a medical bill sitting waiting to be paid for some time, it will ultimately be sent to a debt collection agency to deal with. That can harm your credit, so try to make medical bills your priority if you have a habit of falling behind on payments. 5. Never use your credit card Never needing a credit card should be a sign all is going really well with you financially. However, you must use credit and have a reasonable payment history to get a high credit score. Use your credit card and pay the balance every month. You now have a payment history and zero debt. Final Thoughts Understanding why your credit score is important is connected to what kind of financial future you want to have, which starts with your career. For example, earning a good income, starting or investing in a business, and meeting personal needs like renting or owning a home all require a good credit score. Conversely, ignoring or being oblivious to the importance of your credit score could result in you not reaching your full potential. If you are worried that your credit score might hurt your career prospects, you can take specific measures to improve it. These include improving your credit utilization ratio, making timely payments on bills, paying off any outstanding debts, and rectifying any errors on your credit report. Moreover, it is recommended that you stay updated about the laws and regulations in your region regarding using credit information in employment decisions. This will help you better understand your rights and make informed decisions."

        "Article": "The Role of Business Lines of Credit for New Businesses   Navigating the financial waters of establishing a new business can be both exhilarating and daunting. For budding entrepreneurs and startup visionaries, securing a robust financial footing is paramount to turning innovative ideas into tangible success. In this complex landscape, a business line of credit emerges as a beacon of flexibility and support, offering a lifeline to new businesses that are eager to grow but may encounter unpredictable financial needs. A business line of credit (LOC) is akin to having a reservoir of funds that businesses can tap into as needed rather than receiving a lump sum upfront. A business LOC is a financial tool that’s particularly appealing for new businesses that face the dual challenge of managing day-to-day operations while also needing the agility to respond to growth opportunities or unforeseen expenses. They can draw funds up to a specified limit, pay interest only on the amount used, and replenish the available credit upon repayment. Funding is everything to a startup, so introducing a business line of credit for a new business opens a world of possibilities. It’s not merely a safety net for covering short-term cash flow gaps; it’s a strategic asset that can be leveraged to fuel investment in inventory, equipment, marketing initiatives, or even to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in revenue. This level of financial dexterity is crucial for new businesses still finding their footing in competitive markets. It may not have the extensive economic history required for more traditional loan products. In this broader context, the significance of a business line of credit extends beyond mere financial utility. It represents a vote of confidence in the potential of new businesses, providing them with the means to forge their path with greater assurance and strategic depth. As we delve deeper into the intricacies and advantages of this financial tool, it becomes clear that for new businesses poised on the brink of growth, a line of credit could well be the catalyst that transforms ambition into achievement. Table of Contents Understanding a Business Line of Credit A business line of credit (LOC) is a revolving loan that allows companies to access a predetermined amount of funds, which can be used for various operational needs. Unlike traditional loans, where the borrower receives a lump sum upfront, a LOC allows the flexibility to draw funds up to the credit limit as needed. Interest is only charged on the amount borrowed, not the total credit available, making it a cost-effective solution for managing short-term financial needs. The Lifeline for New Businesses Cash Flow Management For new businesses, which often experience fluctuating revenues and irregular cash flow, a LOC is a buffer to smooth out the financial ebbs and flows. It ensures that companies can cover expenses such as payroll, inventory purchases, and unexpected costs without depleting their cash reserves. Flexibility and Accessibility The flexible nature of a LOC is particularly advantageous for new businesses that may not have predictable financial requirements. It provides the freedom to draw funds as needed, repay, and then reuse the credit, offering a continuous source of capital. Building Credit History Establishing a positive credit history is crucial for any business, and using an LOC responsibly can help new businesses build their credit profiles. This can be beneficial for securing larger loans or better terms in the future. Qualifying for a Business Line of Credit Securing a LOC can be challenging for new businesses due to their limited operating history and lack of financial records. Lenders typically assess a business’s creditworthiness based on credit score, financial statements, cash flow projections, and business plans. New companies can enhance their eligibility by: Maintaining a Strong Personal Credit Score: Lenders may consider the personal credit of the business owners, especially in the absence of extensive business credit history Providing Collateral: Offering assets as collateral can increase the chances of approval and potentially secure more favourable terms. Demonstrating Strong Business Potential: A well-crafted business plan that highlights market potential, revenue projections, and strategic plans for growth can reassure lenders of the business’s viability Strategic Management of a Business Line of Credit Effectively managing an LOC is crucial to maximize its benefits while minimizing costs and risks. Use your LOC wisely by reserving the LOC for short-term needs or emergencies rather than long-term investments. This ensures the credit remains available when most needed. Also, monitor balances and repayments by regularly reviewing the credit balance and making timely repayments to avoid high interest costs and potential damage to credit scores. Additionally, understand the terms by being fully aware of the interest rates, fees, repayment terms, and any conditions that may trigger changes in terms or rates. Final Thoughts It’s not just about having funds available; it’s about creating a strategic financial buffer that empowers businesses to seize opportunities without the constant worry of cash flow disruptions. As these new ventures evolve, the judicious use of a line of credit can play a pivotal role in smoothing out the peaks and valleys of their financial landscape. Moreover, in the fast-paced world of startups and new enterprises, the ability to quickly respond to market demands, invest in emerging technologies, or capitalize on unforeseen opportunities can be the difference between thriving and merely surviving. When managed with foresight and discipline, a business line of credit becomes more than a financial tool—it transforms into a strategic asset, fostering growth and innovation. However, the journey doesn’t end with securing and utilizing a line of credit. It’s equally important for businesses to continuously review their financial strategies, adapt to changing market conditions, and maintain open lines of communication with their lenders. This proactive approach ensures the effective use of the credit line and positions the business as a reliable borrower, potentially leading to more favourable financial arrangements in the future. In conclusion, as new businesses embark on their journey, a business line of credit can serve as a critical component of their financial toolkit, providing the liquidity needed to navigate the uncertainties of the business world. By embracing this financial resource with strategic intent and responsible management, businesses can lay a strong foundation for sustainable growth and long-term success. In the grand scheme of entrepreneurship, a well-managed line of credit is not just a lifeline for today; it’s a stepping stone towards the financial autonomy and resilience that defines tomorrow’s industry leaders."

        "Article": "5 Ways To Strengthen Your Business For A Financial Crisis   People running businesses have a lot of risks to consider every day. One of the things that scare business owners the most, especially those with startups and small businesses, is the thought of a financial crisis. There are various reasons why a financial crisis can hit a business, an industry, or a country, and no matter how much you prepare, it eventually affects people. For example, consider how a virus outbreak in one country can strangle the GDP of many other countries worldwide. Planning to succeed in every aspect of your enterprise, including staff, sales, marketing, and how you bankroll development, is prudent to survive in business. How to fund a business to manage your budget and everything related is covered in the five ways mentioned below. These approaches can help ensure minimum impact on your business in a financial crisis. Table of Contents 1. Maximize Your Liquid Savings Your assets, easily converted into cash, are called your liquid savings. Since they are readily converted into cash, they are like cash itself. The impact on their value is minimal when they are sold. Several factors need to be present for assets to be called liquid savings. These include the fact that when the market is established, there are a lot of buyers interested in purchasing, and the ownership of your assets can be transferred easily and quickly. Liquid items can include but are not limited to checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, and short-term government investments. Cash – Physical currency, such as banknotes and coins, or funds held in a checking account Savings Accounts – Bank savings accounts are considered liquid as they allow easy withdrawals. Money Market Accounts – These accounts often offer higher interest rates than regular savings accounts and maintain liquidity Certificates of Deposit (CDs) – While not as liquid as savings or checking accounts, CDs can still be converted into cash before their maturity date, though penalties may apply Treasury Bills (T-bills) Short-term government securities that are highly liquid and considered low-risk Short-term Investments – Some low-risk, quickly tradable investments like short-term bonds or certain mutual funds can be considered liquid savings Liquid assets are the resources you look at in a crisis, as they can be turned into instant cash at any time. Usually, there are no penalties for taking them out before maturity. Having liquid savings is crucial for financial stability, providing a safety net for unexpected expenses or emergencies. It ensures that individuals or businesses can access funds quickly and without incurring significant losses due to market fluctuations or penalties for early withdrawals. 2. Make a Budget Understanding your financial inflows and outflows is essential for businesses and individuals. It allows you to track your savings, establish an emergency fund, and assess whether you live within your means. Without this knowledge, it becomes challenging to make informed financial decisions. How To Create A Business Budget There is more to creating a business budget than knowing your revenue and expenses. In saying this, if all you know is your sales and costs, it’s a starting point for a budget. This information can let you know if you’re breaking even or growing, but you’ll need more data to set your business to consistently perform in the years ahead. 1. Goals, Targets Experts say it’s best to start your budget with your business goals – creating short- and long-term goals and setting financial targets to achieve them once you have them. To help with the financial targets, you need to know what’s happened to date, and that requires a dig into any historical data, e.g., financial statements, balance sheets, and so on. 2. Expenses, Revenue Do you know your fixed from your variable costs? Fixed costs include rent, salaries, and insurance; variable costs include marketing, office supplies, and utilities. Any expense can be cut or reduced without the business suffering too much. Once you have listed your expenses, including any one-off costs, e.g., technology, equipment, relocation, etc., estimate your revenue from all sources. Use your historical data and knowledge of future sales contracts to generate a revenue forecast. 3. Contingency It is advisable to have a contingency fund to prepare for any unexpected expenses and potential loss of revenue. Allocating a portion of your overall budget, typically between 5% to 10%, as a contingency fund allows for a margin of error in expense calculations. If you feel this percentage is insufficient, you can increase it accordingly. 4. Allocate, Monitor, Review and Revise You’ve now allocated the financial resources to not exceed your projected income. Track your cash flow to ensure that you have enough liquidity to cover your operational needs. Regularly review your budget against your actual financial performance. Adjust your budget as needed based on changes in the business environment. 3. Minimize Your Monthly Bills Ensuring your spending is as little as possible is an excellent practice. That doesn’t mean to start living a minimalist lifestyle immediately. Still, identifying the expenses you can live without is always a good idea, even if you don’t have to cut back on them immediately. But you must be prepared to do it if financial adversity comes your way. You are at an advantage if you are prepared to cut back on your expenses immediately. So keep an eye on your recurring monthly bills. Maintaining a budget will make looking at your monthly spending more accessible and help you determine where you are wasting your money. It could include paying for a landline that you never used to pay the extra fee for a checking account. Regarding the checking account, you can easily opt for a bank that offers free checking accounts. It can also include little things like leaving the heater or the air conditioner on when you leave the office or paying high insurance rates. Whatever the case, it is better to start cutting down immediately. If you don’t, then at least be aware of your expenses. 4. Closely Manage Your Bills Avoiding penalties and late fees is crucial for financial stability. You can ensure you don’t have to pay any extra charges by taking a few simple steps. Start by reviewing all your accounts and bills each month, either manually or with the help of a financial app. Set reminders for payment due dates and consider scheduling automatic payments for recurring bills. Creating a list of all your accounts can also assist with budgeting and keeping track of your expenses. With some planning, you can stay on top of your finances and avoid unnecessary financial burdens. 5. Get Out of Credit Card Debt If you have credit card debt, you can get buried underneath the interest charges you must pay monthly. Pay your credit card debt to reduce your worries and put yourself in a position to build a plan for the future. Once your debt is gone, you can start investing in more important things. Alternatively, you may be using a credit card to fund your business – if so, consider a virtual credit card for managing spending and tracking transactions per user. Conclusion In business, you need to expect the unexpected and plan for every eventuality. We live in a global economy, so the industry is wildly unpredictable. Your business can weather any storm when you have a well-thought-out plan. As the saying goes, ‘People don’t plan to fail; they fail to plan.’ When times get tough, you can avoid falling into business failure by taking the time and resources to adequately prepare for the challenges that lie ahead so your business can thrive no matter what. The best opportunities are often found during adversity, and the prepared businesses come out on top."

        "Article": "Mitigating Financial Risks: How CPAs Protect Small Businesses   Certified public accountants (CPAs) can mitigate a business’s financial risk; to do so, they are more qualified than accountants. For example, in addition to a bachelor’s degree (the bare minimum requirement), CPAs have passed a regulatory exam like the U.S. Uniform CPA Exam and have work experience. CPAs are qualified to provide financial advice to business managers. To engage a CPA, their qualifications come at a premium, whether recruiting one or enlisting a third-party service. A CPA’s extensive education and expertise command a big salary, between five and six figures, depending on experience and seniority. The cost of their services, however, varies by location. Large companies need a CPA’s proficiency, and Small businesses need them just as much for reasons ranging from tax preparation to forecasting growth. Table of Contents Migrating Business’ Financial Risk How does CPA mitigate a business’s financial risk? Internal control Internal control is a less-explored aspect of business growth, but a lack thereof can be deadly. A study published in the Review of Accounting Studies states that accounting fraud cases occur in two out of five companies. As a result, publicly traded businesses lose 1.6% of their collective equity annually; in 2021, the loss was valued at USD$830 billion. Among the most common incidents involve misappropriating business funds, sometimes called embezzlement. Without the proper means to track cash flow, dishonest employees can get away with close to millions by using a legitimate expense as a front. By the time the owner discovers the deception, the company will have lost so much to the point of closure. While a CPA is not required to audit a business, they can assume some essential responsibilities to improve internal control. Examples include: Reviewing receipts and other documents reporting expenses Confirming assets and evaluating inventory procedures Educating employees and clients on the importance of proper accounting Conducting limited background checks on applicants and new hires In a way, a CPA for small businesses is at the forefront of the campaign against corruption and fraud in a business or organization. The International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) stresses that accountants are in a prime position to mitigate the effects of such acts in the public and private sectors, regardless of size, through their work. Tax compliance In September, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced it would adopt AI to go after high-income enterprises that owe millions in back taxes. Among those on the list are dozens of significant partnerships with over USD 10 billion in assets. This reinvigoration of a federal agency that has been underfunded for years should be a wake-up call for business owners to fulfill their tax obligations. Small players with limited revenue and capital can’t afford to earn the agency’s ire, as the penalties can quickly stack up against them. For instance, failure to file taxes on time slaps a 5% penalty for each month of delay and can go up to 25%. There are multiple reasons for such delays, one of which is the struggle to grasp the convoluted federal tax code. It also doesn’t help that the business is responsible for filing other than income tax, such as estimated, employment, and excise taxes. Tax planning and preparation are within the CPA’s list of expertise. Although not as specialized in the procedure as licensed tax preparers, they have extensive knowledge of business tax policies, including potential tax breaks. A company that hires one usually doesn’t need a tax preparer, especially if it needs know-how beyond taxes, such as preparing financial statements. Unlike tax preparers, CPAs are one of a few professionals who can be endowed with the Power of Attorney. With this authorization, they can represent the business on its behalf before the IRS, receiving its tax information and disputing applications of tax policies. A Power of Attorney will last until the business revokes it or appoints a different eligible individual. Financial audit Occasionally, the IRS conducts randomized, independent audits of taxpayers’ returns. While an audit by no means implicates one of an accidental error or possible fraud, it can make business owners understandably nervous. It’s estimated that these audits occur in 1% of tax returns each year, but businesses can increase their chances of being dragged in one in various ways, not the least of which include the following conditions. Revenue increase warranting movement to a different tax bracket Filing income tax when there’s no taxable income to report Filing income tax with transactions from investors and partners Failure to report all taxable income, especially if the IRS can trace it Deductions like home office expenses or using a personal vehicle for business If yours happens to be picked for an audit, the agency will inform you through telephone or mail (never via email). The letter comes with other documents, primarily Form 4549, which outlines the agency’s proposed changes to your returns moving forward. Upon receiving it, you have 30 days to review and dispute the proposal if necessary. However, appealing to the IRS is somewhat akin to taking a matter to court, as it requires valid evidence to support your argument. One such document is a certified financial statement (CFS), which can only be certified by an independent CPA. Balance sheets, cash flow statements, and income statements are common examples. As mentioned previously, a CPA can represent your business before the IRS. That’s why it’s never a bad idea to have one working for you. Business consultation While a welcome advantage, a business degree isn’t required to start a business. If household names like Facebook and Microsoft are any indication, a person doesn’t even need a college degree to do so. Regardless of formal education, any startup owner has to fight an uphill battle to achieve long-term success. Product design and marketing are only the tip of the entrepreneurial iceberg. The less thrilling yet more essential aspects, ranging from managing taxes to paying employees and suppliers, lie underneath. However, no other facet of business management is more crucial than that first step—making the call to start one. You don’t want an idea to sound good only on paper. Some experts recommend discussing it with a CPA to determine its profitability by evaluating the associated costs. In a way, your first meeting with a CPA sets your venture up for later steps in getting the startup off the ground. You’ll know a professional who can help you sort bookkeeping functions and tax obligations, among other things. Conclusion A CPA’s broad range of capabilities makes them a fundamental part of the equation for business success. If you ever plan to hire one, remember to make the most of their multifaceted talents by assigning them vital roles in the organization."

        "Article": "5 Things That Increase Your Risk of Getting Audited by the IRS   While the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) selects tax returns for audit through a combination of random selection and various risk factors, certain situations may increase the likelihood of being audited. Running a business can be stressful enough, and the last thing you want is to be audited by the IRS. Even when a company has nothing to hide, it can be intimidating to handle an IRS audit. More often than not, getting audited is more severe than the event itself. Most audits are done through the mail and may work out in your favor as long as you are honest. Remember that it is essential to seek professional help if you are struggling with your taxes. The factors mentioned in this article do not guarantee an audit, and many audits are conducted randomly. That being said, below are five things that may put you on the IRS’s radar. Table of Contents Making More Money According to IRS statistics from 2016, if you show a significant increase in income from one year to the next, your chances of getting audited can increase from 0.65% to anywhere from 1.7% to 5.9%, depending on your reported income. In addition to the increase in potential auditing by moving into a new tax bracket, sudden increases in income – especially for self-employed individuals – will be red-flagged by the IRS, even when they are legitimate. Filing Income Tax When It’s Unnecessary If you file an income tax when you had no taxable income for the year, especially if you previously had, you are at higher risk of getting audited. While you must file a return regardless of how much income you made, the absence of income will raise eyebrows in the IRS. Not Reporting All Taxable Income All taxable income is required to be reported to the IRS, especially if it is traceable. The IRS receives copies of all tax forms that you receive. The IRS tracks anything paid to you by other entities, such as salary payments (W-2s or 1099s), dividend income, and interest paid. Tax professionals can review your files before submitting them to ensure you are not missing any pertinent information. Improper Use of Reported Income If you report income used for purposes other than stated, you increase your chances of getting contacted by the IRS. This typically happens when people invest money into an idea. Tax Evasion You are at perhaps the highest risk of getting audited by not paying or purposely underpaying taxes. There are many clues the IRS will look for to find individuals who are participating in tax evasion. Some red flags include claiming 100% use of assets (such as a vehicle) for business, deducting business travel and meals, taking higher-than-average deductions compared to other companies in your field, or anything else that could be seen stretching the truth. This is especially true with self-employed individuals. For some individuals, nothing is more terrifying than getting contacted by the IRS. In reality, these routine audits should be nothing more than a formality you must engage in as a professional. Audits are nothing to be concerned about for an honest taxpayer. More Factors Are you keen to know more factors that may increase your IRS audit risk? Foreign Bank Accounts and Income The IRS is vigilant about offshore income and assets. Failing to report foreign bank accounts or income can lead to severe consequences. Rental Property Individuals with rental properties may be subject to audits, especially if there are discrepancies in reported rental income and expenses. Frequent Use of Cash Transactions A high volume of cash transactions without proper documentation may attract attention from the IRS. Last Few Words Please remember that attempting to evade or avoid an IRS audit through illegal or unethical means is not advisable and can lead to severe consequences. The IRS has various methods to identify and address non-compliance. To state the obvious, it’s essential to be honest and accurate when filing your taxes. If you’re unsure about certain deductions or have complex financial situations, consider seeking advice from a tax professional to ensure compliance with tax laws. Keep thorough records and retain documentation to support your claims in case of an audit."

        "Article": "ZipBooks Versus QuickBooks for Mac: Who is winning the Game?   Subscription-based accounting software offers several advantages, including regular updates, accessibility from anywhere with an internet connection, scalability, and often lower upfront costs compared to traditional on-premises software. Popular subscription-based accounting software includes platforms like QuickBooks and ZipBooks. These platforms provide a range of features, including invoicing, expense tracking, financial reporting, and integration with other business tools. However they are not the same and there are differences worth knowing including range in price, features, and even level of customer support. Which is the best for your bookkeeping needs? Let’s find out. Table of Contents ZipBooks Designed to be the perfect fit for small entrepreneurs. In other words, startups and micro-businesses that have minimal transactions to record every month can benefit significantly from ZipBooks. It is an excellent ‘starter’ accounting program for entrepreneurs or freelancers and clearly better than using computer spreadsheets or handwritten ledgers. Dashboard The ZipBooks Dashboard includes Quick Stats, Accounts Receivable, Key to Bar Graph, and your Business Health Score. Quick Stats is a section that offers an instant snapshot of revenues collected over the past year as well as the previous month’s net income. A current-to-date accounts receivable balance is displayed, and there is the option to click for more details under the categories of View Report, where you can dig deeper into the Aging A/R stats. A bar graph appears, and the key is explained here. Blue shows revenue, gold is expenses, and green indicates profit. The green bar shows in red when expenses are more significant than revenue. Business Health Score will show a figure out of 100. If the number is low, you can click on it, and the ZipBooks program will provide suggestions on improving your bookkeeping setup. Customer Service While both ZipBooks and QuickBooks provide customer service when compared head-to-head, QuickBooks offers much more than ZipBooks. Here is a look at what each provides: Zipbooks provides multiple options for customer services, including chat and helpdesk. All you have to do to reach a ZipBooks support agent is log into your account and click the “Start A Conversation” (lower right corner of the screen). You can search for assistance by typing a keyword or two into the search window. The Accounting Basics section has several FAQs and step-by-step instructions on how to start using this program. Pricing There are a total of four different pricing plans. They range from $0 to $125 per month. Here is a look at each: ZipBooks Starter is free and provides access for one user. It allows you to produce an unlimited number of invoices and unlimited customer/vendor contact tracking. It connects to a single bank/credit card account. Another ZipBooks Smarter starts at $15 per month, but it gives you the ability to have an unlimited number of users. You can automatically send unlimited recurring invoices and track hours worked by contractors/employees. This program will quickly transfer those hours to customer invoices. ZipBooks Sophisticated starts at $35 per month and includes everything in the ZipBooks Smarter program with some extras. They include tracking of income/expenses by location/project. You will also be able to create bank reconciliations, and there are advanced reporting features. The last, ZipBooks Services, is the top level, costing $125 monthly. It provides a dedicated bookkeeper who will categorize all transactions and reconcile bank and credit card accounts, plus one more feature. You will have someone who will prepare monthly financial statements for you. QuickBooks for Mac On the other hand, QuickBooks is designed to fit well with any size business and is the best-known of the pair. It has many more features and has a vast network of advisors. Plus, QuickBooks is used by more businesses than any other software program. It has three different business tiers designed to fit various-sized enterprises. While it is a good fit for entrepreneurs, medium-sized companies, and giant corporations, this program is more expensive. However, it has several more features than ZipBooks. Dashboard The QuickBooks Dashboard contains a Left Menu Bar, Sales, Profit and Loss, Expenses, and Invoice tabs. The left menu is a multi-functional menu bar as it gives you access to most program features in the same way keyboard shortcuts would. The sales section gives you a visual of sales figures with an ongoing updated current figure for reference. Then, you can monitor the profit and loss situation of your business without having to run a report for the same data. QuickBooks offer omnichannel customer support, including chat, phone, email, knowledgebase, guideline, and various tutorials. You can reach a QuickBooks support agent by logging into your account and clicking the ‘Help’ option. You can phone to speak to a support agent six days a week (6 AM – 6 PM PST on weekdays, 6 AM – 3 PM PST on Saturdays). A free course with video tutorials and written instructions to aid you in setting up your bookkeeping program. There are a total of three different pricing plans.

They have unpaid bill tracking, check printing, and access for up to three users and two accountants. And the third plan starts at $50 per month and comes with all the Essentials features. Added to this is access for up to five users and two accountants. Additional extras are tracking reports for 1099 contractors, budgeting/forecasting tools, and project tracking. Ease of Use Both ZipBooks and QuickBooks for Mac are designed to be user-friendly. Plus, you do not require a bookkeeping background to use or understand how these programs work. Both utilize simple language rather than industry terminology, aiding the user experience. The main difference at startup is the dashboard’s appearance on each program. Here is a look at each of them: In Conclusion The decision on which of the accounting software programs, ZipBooks or QuickBooks, is best for your business depends on the size of your business. Both can accommodate any size company, although ZipBooks is probably best suited for smaller entrepreneurs. If you demand more features, then QuickBooks would be your obvious choice."

        "Article": "How To Keep Track Of Your Business Finances   One of the essential elements of running a successful company is tracking business finances, which involves keeping tabs on business income and expenses. A lack of funds is one of the primary reasons why businesses fail. Cash flow is crucial, so companies must manage expenses by recording receipts, payments, or expenses into an accounting ledger. There are also several benefits of tracking your business finances, including: Managing your money more effectively Identifying spending issues Improving your budgets Promoting savings Remaining focused on your financial goals Keeping tabs on your business finances ensures your company grows well to overcome competition. So, how can you implement various strategies to monitor your business finances? By taking the following actions: Table of Contents Developing A Cash Flow Statement Creating a cash flow statement is the first and most straightforward way to keep track of your business finances. It’s one of the final accounts and provides information regarding an enterprise’s health. For instance, it offers insights into how cash and cash equivalents change over time. Simply, a cash flow statement shows how money gets in and out of the company. In addition, a cash flow statement tells you how you get and utilize money. As such, you’ll be able to track your finances. However, you must come up with a comprehensive cash flow statement. In other words, it should comprise three major sections: financing, investing, and operating activities. One of the best ways to prepare a cash flow statement is to work with experts. However, you can complete the task yourself if you don’t have enough budget to hire a professional. Consider watching online videos and reading blogs on how to make a cash flow statement. Keeping A Separate Business Bank Account Another simple but effective strategy for tracking business finances is to open a separate business bank account. Doing so helps separate your personal and business money. As a result, you’ll know how much money gets in and out of your business. Although separating business and personal bank accounts is necessary for tracking company finances, some business owners still ignore this step. You should avoid this kind of mistake since it could be stressful. For instance, you might struggle to calculate taxes, leading to underpaying or overpaying taxes. Leveraging The Power Of Accounting Software Modern technologies form an integral part of running a business. They help streamline operations to save time and other resources. So, consider integrating new technologies into your business systems. Any company area can benefit from new technologies, and tracking finances is no exception. You can do that by installing accounting software. This application helps store business accounting information in digital form. You can also use it to keep track of business finances. Utilizing accounting software to track business finances is beneficial since it minimizes errors. Tracking finances manually increases the risks of human error, so you won’t get a clear picture of your company’s position. One more advantage of utilizing accounting software is it will lower expenses. For example, you can generate payment and expense reports in no time. This eliminates hiring a whole team for financial data entry and analysis. A few staff members will be enough to complement the already installed accounting software. As a consequence, you’ll reduce labor costs. However, not every accounting software on the market can be suitable for tracking your business finances. You should exercise due diligence to find the right tool for your organization. For example, a housing association’s accounting and financial reporting needs differ from those required by a retail business. Accounting software for housing associations will need to include the following: Ability to track and manage rent payments. Track property-related expenses Integrate with bank accounts Automation of routine tasks such as invoicing and payment reminders Security measures for access Audits tracking changes and user activity Additionally, ensure that you source your accounting software from a reputable vendor. Connecting All Your Financial Institutions Managing various bank accounts from different financial institutions isn’t easy. In that case, you can connect your bank accounts by using accounting software. Connecting your bank accounts lets you manage your finances from a centralized location. Furthermore, it allows you to automatically download and post all your bank transactions to the appropriate ledgers. All this helps you track your business finances more efficiently. For instance, you can account for every payment received or expense incurred by your enterprise. Using Cash Accounting Or Accrual Accounting Basis Cash and accrual accounting are both acceded principles in recording payments and expenses. However, for consistency purposes, you should choose one. Before you track your business finances, decide whether to settle for a cash or accrual accounting basis. With the cash accounting method, you’ll record financial transactions. For instance, you register the payment as income only when received. Likewise, you document expenses once you pay them. On the other hand, an accrual accounting basis requires you to record income and expenses as soon as they occur. Therefore, you won’t have to wait until you receive money or make payments to register on your books of accounts. Using either cash or accrual accounting method gives you a complete view of your business, enabling you to easily track finances. Reviewing Expenses Regularly Regularly reviewing and categorizing business expenses is an effective way to track your finances. Going over your costs allows you to develop a deeper understanding of your business and find ways to grow it. By reviewing expenses regularly, you can control costs as well. You’ll know how much and what you’re spending your money on. You see these everyday figures as a marker to check whether you’re under or over your monthly budget. Apart from becoming financially aware of your expenses, you can determine the proper budget, eliminate bad spending habits, and adopt good ones. Takeaway Whether you and your team have a small business or a large enterprise, tracking business finances is a surefire way to reach your goals. Monitoring finances is essential since it’s one of the best ways to promote growth and ensure your company’s success. Hence, if your business isn’t keeping tabs on its expenses, you should start drafting a plan for managing all your business finances today."

        "Article": "The Steps To Starting An HVAC Business   For several reasons, starting an HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) business can be a worthwhile venture. There is a growing demand for the units as they are more energy-efficient than other heating and cooling systems. Plus, your HVAC business can sell the units, installation, and ongoing maintenance services. Providing maintenance services can result in a steady stream of recurring revenue. Many customers opt for regular maintenance contracts to ensure their HVAC systems operate efficiently and avoid unexpected breakdowns. Even during economic downturns, people and businesses still require functioning heating and cooling systems, and as more residential and commercial buildings are constructed, they are continuously needed. However, starting an HVAC business can be a complex process, and it’s essential to understand all the steps involved, from registering your business as an LLC and applying for the necessary permits and licenses to learning about the regulations and understanding the market. If you are already an HVAC technician, then you appreciate the business of HVAC installation and repair. However, as a technician, you’re not automatically set up for success as a business owner. With this Business Blog guide, you’ll have all the information you need to confidently start your HVAC business. Table of Contents Business Basics Your first action in starting a business includes several steps that will vary depending on your location and the type of business you’re creating. Market Research Business Plan Business Structure Regulations and licenses Suppliers Inventory Systems Research All businesses must be thoroughly researched before committing funds – yours and maybe a loan. Before launching your HVAC business, do market research. Be sure you know why you want to have your own HVAC business and that it is for the right reasons. Identify your target market, competition, and potential demand for your product or service in the location or area you wish to operate. Know who your competitors are and if there is room for another operator. Your research will reveal if there are any gaps in products and services that you can fulfill and, therefore, create your own market without direct competitors. For pricing models, consider a subscription service model where your clients pay a monthly or quarterly fee for their HVAC servicing. The subscription service model is attractive to businesses as it helps them ensure they have regular cash flow. The cost of starting an HVAC business ranges from $2000 – $10,000. However, you will more than likely exceed this estimate. Remember to research startup costs so you know you can afford it and, if not, how you will fund it. Your startup costs and projections will be itemized in your business plan. Research Suppliers and Equipment One of the most critical aspects of establishing a successful HVAC business is sourcing quality supplies and equipment from reliable vendors. Start by researching which names are well-reviewed among your peers, and consider talking to veteran HVAC professionals who’ve been in the biz for years. You should also compare prices between suppliers to ensure you get the best deal on materials, tools, and other needed parts. You may get discounts or exclusive pricing if you sign up for their customer loyalty programs or negotiate bulk purchases. Business Plan Create a detailed business plan outlining your goals, target audience, marketing strategy, financial projections, and operational plan. There really is no way around this requirement. For funding, lenders will ask for your business plan, and you will need to ensure it has information on how you plan to fund your business, whether through personal savings, loans, investors, or other means. Your business plan will also detail your staffing requirements, technology needs, marketing and sales strategy, and budget. Business Structure When starting your HVAC business, you will need to decide on the legal structure of your business. Do you want it as a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company (LLC), or corporation? The structure will impact your liability, taxation, and other legal aspects. The very first decision is to pick the proper business structure. Each entity has other pros and cons, too. For example, an LLC offers limited liability protection but also requires filing fees, while a corporation allows you to have investors but also carries additional compliance requirements and paperwork. Seek professional advice from an accountant before choosing the business structure for your HVAC business. Business Name Choosing a business name for your HVAC company is fun. Make sure it’s unique to do that. You will need to check its availability. Register your business name with the appropriate government authorities. Regulations and Requirements Every business is subject to specific regulations, including those for HVAC businesses. You might need a license, zoning approval, or other local regulations depending on where your business is located. Make sure to research the regulations for your state and county to ensure compliance before you start. Understanding any requirements imposed by insurance companies or other entities is also essential. The initial research you do will help keep you from running into surprise costs down the line. As you must comply with local, state, and federal regulations related to your industry, add what your business needs to your business plan, including costs for compliance. Tax ID, Business Bank Account, Financial Systems Obtain a tax identification number (TIN) or employer identification number (EIN) from the tax authorities. Open a business bank account to separate your business finances from personal finances. Then, choose an accounting system to manage your finances. To manage cash flow, use an online SaaS subscription model like Xero. Once you have organized your account, it is time to set up a system for invoicing, tracking expenses, and managing cash flow. Insurance We recommend getting business insurance, including premises, contents, limited liability, and professional indemnity. Insurance is necessary for risk mitigation and asset protection. If you have staff, you will also need Workers Compensation Insurance. Hire Staff Your business will need staff, and they will most likely be employees. In your business plan, establish a hiring process and create job descriptions. Familiarize yourself with employment laws and regulations. Your newly hired technicians will need to be HVAC certified. Hire technicians who are either already approved or cut down on costs in the early stages of your HVAC startup, including an apprenticeship program. It’s important to remember your reputation as a quality service business will depend on your technicians having completed their apprenticeship or gone to trade school, technical school, or community college. Marketing and Sales Develop a marketing strategy to promote your business. This could include online marketing, traditional advertising, and other promotional activities. A relevant and detailed marketing plan will ensure your HVAC business gets prospective customers. To grow your pipeline of prospective customers, have a website, and invest in SEO to rank highly for local keyword searches. There’s no harm in having profiles on social media platforms to increase your reach and launch online ads that target a specific audience, such as homeowners in your area. Traditional marketing tactics like printing coupons and distributing business cards to local shops, restaurants, and other businesses also work. Utilizing multiple methods can help you attract more clients quickly and establish yourself as an expert in the industry. You will need to know how to sell and close to turn prospects into actual customers. Develop a sales strategy and templates for your salespeople so there is consistency and a steady, proven system for customer acquisition. Final Words Regularly review your business plan and financials for your HVAC business. Adapt your strategies based on performance and changing market conditions."

        "Article": "How To Turn Financial Distress Into Financial Success   Financial distress for business owners can result from a variety of factors. Some causes are unforeseen and uncontrolled, like an economic downturn and regulation changes. There are also plenty of causes of business distress that directly result from something the company or management did or failed to do. This article focuses on what a business can control and foresee and what is required to turn a company from dying to thriving. First, let’s consider why businesses need to be profitable. Table of Contents Why Businesses Need To Be Profitable Many startup businesses are in the red and then get to break even. However, to survive, companies need to make a profit, and there are several crucial reasons. Sustainability Profit is essential for the long-term sustainability of a business. It provides the necessary funds to cover operational expenses, invest in growth, and adapt to changing market conditions. Investment and Growth Businesses need to be competitive to attract customers and to do this, they need to become sustainable. Funds are required for reinvestment in the business, which could involve expanding operations, developing new products or services, upgrading technology, or entering new markets. Without profits, a business may struggle to fund these growth initiatives.  If the funds can not come entirely from profit, the company must attract capital from investors. Investors and lenders are more likely to support businesses that demonstrate a track record of profitability. Capital providers want to see a return on their investment through loans or equity investments, and profits signal that the business can deliver this. Attract and Retain Staff A profitable business can attract and retain talented employees by offering competitive salaries, benefits, and career development opportunities. Employees are more likely to stay with a company that can provide stability and growth. Technology like AI and automation can do many tasks in most business areas today. However, human staff are needed for strategic roles in marketing and sales, customer support, and operations management. Risk Management and Obligations Profit serves as a buffer against unforeseen challenges and risks. It provides a financial cushion to help a business weather economic downturns, industry fluctuations, or unexpected expenses. Businesses must meet various financial obligations, such as paying suppliers, servicing debts, and fulfilling employee commitments. A company may struggle to meet these obligations without profit, leading to economic instability. Common Causes Of Financial Distress Now we know why a business needs to be profitable, let’s look at common causes of financial distress. 1. Poor Financial Management and Cash Flow Inadequate financial planning and monitoring is often the start of the demise of a business. Without it your business can not prepare of events that will challenge your revenue. With enough revenue to cover expenses, your business can keep operating. However, there is always financial stress when a company is just breaking even.  Any negative event can push the business into the red and negative cash flow. To survive, all businesses need to be profitable.  We recently updated an article on the topic of cash flow for the self-employed, in which many small businesses are budding startups. Solution Implement robust financial management practices, regularly review financial statements, and seek professional advice. Improve invoicing and collections processes, negotiate better payment terms with suppliers, and maintain a cash reserve for emergencies. 2. High Levels of Debt There are two types of debt. Good debt and bad debt. Which do you have? Good debt is typically associated with investments that have the potential to increase in value over time. Examples include student loans (investing in education), mortgages (investing in real estate), and business loans (investing in a business). Loans for investments that also have low interest rates are the best. For example, mortgage rates and student loan rates are often lower than interest rates on credit cards Excessive debt and high interest payments can strain finances.  Additionally, all that debt will be weighing on your mind. Solution Restructure debt, negotiate with creditors for better terms, and focus on reducing unnecessary expenses. Many small business owners use their home loans for business purposes because it is a lower interest rate than a standard business loan. However, this action does come with the risk that if the business fails, the loan repayments still need to be made and the loan repaid within the loan term. 3. Market Competition Intense competition can erode profit margins and market share. Solution Conduct a thorough market analysis, differentiate products or services, and explore new markets or customer segments.  Consider reading the book The Immutable Laws of Marketing to hone your strategies to become a leader in a new market with few or no competitors. 4. Operational Inefficiencies Inefficient processes can lead to increased costs and reduced productivity. Solution Streamline operations, invest in technology for automation, and optimize the supply chain to enhance efficiency.  Use SaaS, which spreads the cost of software services for managing your operations from bookkeeping to marketing. 5. Lack of Strategic Planning The absence of a clear business strategy can result in poor decision-making.  Operating your business without a plan is high risk. Solution Develop a strategic plan, set measurable goals, and regularly review and adapt the plan based on market conditions. Make sure to check your progress by also setting milestones so you know your business is doing what it needs to do to become sustainable. 6. Ineffective Marketing Inadequate marketing can result in reduced customer acquisition and retention.  Being the ‘world’s best-kept secret’ is not what you want for your business. Solution Invest in targeted marketing campaigns, enhance the online presence, and focus on building strong customer relationships. Hire a marketing team who knows how to create a business presence on social media and create relevant content on your website to share with your followers and in a regular email marketing campaign.  SEO is more vital today than ever as Google updates its search algorithms often.  Is your website set up for Google Analytics 4? Final Words Turning a company around often involves a combination of these strategies tailored to the specific challenges faced by the business. Business owners can seek professional advice, engage with stakeholders, and proactively address financial distress to achieve long-term financial success. Awareness of common causes and solutions will enable your business to reverse financial distress into financial success.  "

        "Article": "How To Improve Cash Flow When Self Employed   Managing cash flow is crucial for self-employed individuals to ensure the stability and success of their businesses. Budgeting helps hone a business owner’s focus on performance and income versus spending. Other ways to improve your cash flow include managing your invoices and receivables keeping a close eye on expenses and financing options. This article covers ways you can manage your cash flow better when employed, which is the tax status of most new businesses before they are incorporated. Table of Contents Create A Detailed Budget If your business is financially challenging, creating a budget is the first thing you need to do. When you take the time to budget int, resting revelations occur. For example, you will probably find you’ve been spending more than you’re earning or overspending during months when less income is received. It’s better to be informed and in control rather than deal with the fallout of sudden cash flow shortfalls. When you carefully look at expenses and see what needs to be trimmed, leave everything on the table. For example, underperforming small businesses may need to save money by downsizing office space. Or letting go of your commercial office and setting up remote working for you and your team. If your type of offering needs a workplace, you can consider flexible leasing arrangements or co-working spaces where there may not be a lease. Additionally, if you’re downsizing your office space, you can sell your office equipment and use what’s available in the co-sharing environment. How to create a budget Creating a budget is crucial for managing your finances effectively, primarily when you are self-employed. Develop a comprehensive budget outlining your fixed and variable expenses, forecast income, and an emergency or contingency fund. Expenses Categorize expenses into essential and non-essential to prioritize payments during lean periods. Fixed expenses – e.g., rent/lease, utilities, insurance, loan payments, subscriptions. Variable expenses, e.g., marketing and advertising, office supplies, travel expenses, meals and entertainment, and professional fees (accountant, lawyer, etc.) Forecast Income Project your future income to anticipate potential cash flow gaps when considering your current expenses and when they are due. Consider seasonal fluctuations and irregularities in income. With this awareness, you may find time to consider a side hustle. Set Aside Emergency Funds Establish an emergency or contingency fund to cover unexpected expenses or periods of low income. Having a financial cushion can help you weather temporary setbacks. Consider a Line of Credit Explore the possibility of obtaining a business line of credit to cover short-term cash flow gaps. With a line of credit, you can draw down and repay as and when required to cover shortfalls in cash flow. Use it judiciously and pay it off promptly to avoid accruing excessive interest. Invoice Promptly and Follow Up on Payments Send out invoices promptly after completing a job or delivering a product. Follow up on overdue payments to ensure a steady cash flow. Use Technology for Invoicing and Accounting Utilize invoicing and accounting software to streamline financial processes. Automated systems can help you stay organized and track your cash flow in real time. Choose a service with an app so you can send out an invoice from your phone to speed up the task. You can also receive alerts of payments. Offer Discounts for Early Payments Encourage prompt payment by offering discounts to clients who pay invoices early. Be discerning with whom you work with. Choose clients who pay promptly and reward them accordingly. Negotiate Favorable Payment Terms Negotiate payment terms with suppliers that align with your cash flow cycle. You will want to ensure you are considered a valuable customer so your suppliers provide discounts and the best deals. Seek extended payment terms or discounts for early payments when dealing with vendors. Negotiate either longer payment terms or a cheaper rate for paying early. Diversify Income Streams Managing cash flow when you’re self-employed is an ongoing challenge. You think you’ve got it all sorted out, and then you lose a supplier or customer and, with it, the favorable terms that have helped you manage your cash flow. To ease the burden with your primary offering, explore additional sources of income to reduce dependence on a single client or revenue stream. Side hustles can turn into full-time businesses. Diversification of income streams can provide stability if one income source is temporarily disrupted. Monitor and Control Expenses Regularly review your expenses to identify areas where costs can be reduced. You may have a new budget; however, over time, more payments will be required, so you need to manage your existing outgoings for their relevancy. Cut unnecessary expenses and make a date in your calendar to regularly renegotiate contracts with suppliers if possible. Build Strong Client Relationships: Cultivate strong relationships with clients to encourage repeat business. It is easier to sell to and retain a customer than acquire a new one.  Plus, selling to an existing customer will cost less, and satisfied clients are more likely to pay promptly and recommend your services. Regularly Review and Adjust Periodically review your cash flow management strategies and adjust them based on your business’s evolving needs. Be flexible and adapt to changes in the market or your industry. By implementing these steps, self-employed individuals can enhance their ability to manage cash flow effectively, reducing financial stress and promoting the long-term success of their businesses. Keep Business and Personal Finances Separate According to Inc. Magazine, small business owners must maintain separate business and personal expenses accounts. Otherwise, you risk putting too much of your personal funds into your business. With a business bank account, you can automatically transfer data to your tax and financial statements, making the accountant’s job easier and cheaper. Pay Yourself the Market Rate Inc. also advises small business owners to not undercut their own salary. Many small business owners try to low-ball bids beyond a figure that allows them to make a living wage. Charging too little harms cash flow and makes sticking to a budget tough. Later, you will have to charge customers more for your products or services. Get Financial Advice from a Professional There is so much to do when you are in business for yourself. It is okay not to know everything. If you are not a financial professional, it makes sense to consult the services of a financial planner for small business owners when you get in a bad situation. The Small Business Administration has retired business professionals who can provide advice on budgeting, marketing, and financial planning. Their advice is free."
